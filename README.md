Library to detect bots and crawlers using fingerprinting.

# Attributes collected
Fingerprint Scanner relies on [Fp-Collect](https://github.com/antoinevastel/fp-collect) to collect fingerprints in the browser.

# Warning
The library is still in its early phase, many changes may occur.
More tests are coming soon.
